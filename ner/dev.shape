refusing	xxxx

they	xxxx
backed	xxxx

Friday	Xxxxx
from	xxxx
some	xxxx
earlier	xxxx
plans	xxxx
that	xxxx

have	xxxx
delayed	xxxx
the	xxx

including	xxxx
a	x

that	xxxx
three	xxxx
Florida	Xxxxx

send	xxxx
1.17	d.dd

to	xx

in	xx

to	xx
the	xxx
1.16	d.dd

from	xxxx
Palm	Xxxx

and	xxx
Miami-Dade	Xxxxx
counties	xxxx
that	xxxx
finished	xxxx
arriving	xxxx

Friday	Xxxxx

Instead	Xxxxx
,	,
the	xxx
Bush	Xxxx

agreed	xxxx
to	xx
the	xxx
proposal	xxxx
by	xx
Sauls	Xxxxx
that	xxxx
the	xxx
ballots	xxxx
in	xx
Volusia	Xxxxx
,	,
Broward	Xxxxx

Pinellas	Xxxxx

simply	xxxx
be	xx
impounded	xxxx
as	xx
possible	xxxx
evidence	xxxx
where	xxxx
they	xxxx
are	xxx
,	,
and	xxx
not	xxx
be	xx
transported	xxxx
.	.
Bush	Xxxx
's	'x
lawyers	xxxx
also	xxxx
said	xxxx
they	xxxx
would	xxxx
not	xxx
insist	xxxx
that	xxxx
the	xxx
opening	xxxx
of	xx
the	xxx
trial	xxxx
deal	xxxx
with	xxxx
a	x
series	xxxx
of	xx
new	xxx
issues	xxxx
they	xxxx
raised	xxxx
in	xx
a	x
brief	xxxx
on	xx
Thursday	Xxxxx
night	xxxx
.	.
Those	Xxxxx
issues	xxxx
include	xxxx
whether	xxxx
Gore	Xxxx
is	xx
really	xxxx
a	x
candidate	xxxx
entitled	xxxx
to	xx
bring	xxxx
a	x
contest	xxxx
lawsuit	xxxx
_	_
technically	xxxx

only	xxxx
the	xxx
electors	xxxx

whether	xxxx

can	xxx
truly	xxxx
be	xx
contested	xxxx
under	xxxx
Florida	Xxxxx
law	xxx
.	.
The	Xxx
Bush	Xxxx
team	xxxx
also	xxxx
agreed	xxxx
to	xx
call	xxxx
no	xx
more	xxxx
than	xxxx
20	dd
witnesses	xxxx
at	xx
the	xxx
trial	xxxx
,	,
not	xxx

Thursday	Xxxxx
night	xxxx
.	.
Gore	Xxxx
's	'x
lawyers	xxxx
plan	xxxx
to	xx
call	xxxx
two	xxx

The	Xxx
willingness	xxxx
of	xx
the	xxx
Bush	Xxxx
team	xxxx
to	xx
pare	xxxx
down	xxxx
its	xxx
demands	xxxx
may	xxx
have	xxxx
come	xxxx
from	xxxx
the	xxx
realization	xxxx
that	xxxx
Sauls	Xxxxx
was	xxx
not	xxx
going	xxxx
to	xx
allow	xxxx
any	xxx
obvious	xxxx
delay	xxxx
tactics	xxxx
in	xx
the	xxx
trial	xxxx
.	.
The	Xxx
judge	xxxx
said	xxxx
he	xx
understood	xxxx
why	xxx
Gore	Xxxx
needed	xxxx
to	xx
accelerate	xxxx
the	xxx
process	xxxx
;	;
if	xx
the	xxx
trial	xxxx
,	,
the	xxx
vote-counting	xxxx
and	xxx
any	xxx
subsequent	xxxx
appeals	xxxx
extend	xxxx
beyond	xxxx
Dec	Xxx
.	.
12	dd
,	,
the	xxx
Florida	Xxxxx
Legislature	Xxxxx
will	xxxx
send	xxxx
Bush	Xxxx
's	'x
electors	xxxx
to	xx
the	xxx
Electoral	Xxxxx
College	Xxxxx
and	xxx
the	xxx

likely	xxxx
become	xxxx
moot	xxxx
.	.
At	Xx
a	x
preliminary	xxxx
hearing	xxxx
Friday	Xxxxx
afternoon	xxxx
,	,
Sauls	Xxxxx
made	xxxx
it	xx
clear	xxxx
he	xx
would	xxxx
take	xxxx
a	x
no-nonsense	xx

to	xx
the	xxx

Lawyers	Xxxxx
for	xxx
the	xxx

the	xxx

would	xxxx
not	xxx
be	xx
allowed	xxxx
to	xx
repeat	xxxx

already	xxxx
made	xxxx
,	,
he	xx
said	xxxx
,	,
an	xx

because	xxxx

Mario	Xxxxx

it	xx
is	xx
realistic	xxxx
to	xx
retain	xxxx
a	x
few	xxx
doubts	xxxx
about	xxxx
what	xxxx
will	xxxx
come	xxxx
.	.
In	Xx
sports	xxxx
terms	xxxx
,	,
his	xxx
closest	xxxx
parallel	xxxx
is	xx
Michael	Xxxxx
Jordan	Xxxxx
,	,
who	xxx
spent	xxxx
almost	xxxx
two	xxx
seasons	xxxx
away	xxxx
from	xxxx
the	xxx
NBA	XXX
before	xxxx
returning	xxxx
in	xx
1995	dddd
to	xx
lead	xxxx
the	xxx
Chicago	Xxxxx
Bulls	Xxxxx
to	xx
three	xxxx
more	xxxx
championships	xxxx

Like	Xxxx
Jordan	Xxxxx
,	,
Lemieux	Xxxxx
became	xxxx
part-owner	xxxx
of	xx
a	x
team	xxxx
after	xxxx
retirement	xxxx
.	.
Unlike	Xxxxx
Jordan	Xxxxx
,	,
Lemieux	Xxxxx
is	xx
now	xxx
both	xxxx
an	xx
equity	xxxx
investor	xxxx
and	xxx
an	xx
employee	xxxx
.	.
After	Xxxxx
3	d
1/2	d/d
years	xxxx
of	xx
retirement	xxxx
,	,
Lemieux	Xxxxx
played	xxxx
for	xxx
the	xxx
Penguins	Xxxxx
Wednesday	Xxxxx

contributing	xxxx
one	xxx
goal	xxxx
and	xxx
two	xxx

to	xx
a	x
5-0	d
victory	xxxx
over	xxxx
Toronto	Xxxxx
.	.
In	Xx
so	xx
doing	xxxx
,	,
Lemieux	Xxxxx
pushed	xxxx
the	xxx
NHL	XXX
into	xxxx
the	xxx
realm	xxxx
of	xx
real	xxxx
news	xxxx
,	,
something	xxxx
it	xx
has	xxx
not	xxx
experienced	xxxx
since	xxxx
Wayne	Xxxxx
Gretzky	Xxxxx
's	'x
highly	xxxx
orchestrated	xxxx
retirement	xxxx
in	xx
1999	dddd
.	.
The	Xxx
Lemieux	Xxxxx
comeback	xxxx
story	xxxx
is	xx
hard	xxxx
to	xx
resist	xxxx
because	xxxx
it	xx
has	xxx
all	xxx
the	xxx
hooks	xxxx
.	.
The	Xxx
first	xxxx
is	xx
talent	xxxx
.	.
As	Xx
the	xxx
second-best	xxxx
player	xxxx
of	xx
the	xxx
Gretzky	Xxxxx
era	xxx
,	,
Lemieux	Xxxxx
never	xxxx
got	xxx
the	xxx
recognition	xxxx
he	xx
deserved	xxxx
.	.
The	Xxx
second	xxxx
factor	xxxx
is	xx
health	xxxx
.	.
Lemieux	Xxxxx
survived	xxxx
Hodgkin	Xxxxx
's	'x
disease	xxxx
and	xxx
chronic	xxxx
back	xxxx
problems	xxxx
.	.
The	Xxx
third	xxxx
element	xxxx
is	xx
money	xxxx
.	.
Lemieux	Xxxxx
rescued	xxxx
his	xxx
team	xxxx
from	xxxx
bankruptcy	xxxx
last	xxxx
season	xxxx
by	xx
exchanging	xxxx
deferred	xxxx
salary	xxxx
for	xxx
an	xx
ownership	xxxx
stake	xxxx
.	.
But	Xxx
the	xxx
franchise	xxxx
still	xxxx
seeks	xxxx
new	xxx
investors	xxxx
and	xxx
a	x
new	xxx
arena	xxxx
to	xx
replace	xxxx
the	xxx
NHL	XXX
's	'x
oldest	xxxx
rink	xxxx
.	.
Mix	Xxx
in	xx
the	xxx
family	xxxx
angle	xxxx
_	_
his	xxx
young	xxxx
son	xxx
wants	xxxx
to	xx
see	xxx
him	xxx
play	xxxx
!	!
Finally	Xxxxx
,	,
sprinkle	xxxx
it	xx
generously	xxxx
with	xxxx
competitive	xxxx
flavoring	xxxx
because	xxxx
Lemieux	Xxxxx
's	'x
presence	xxxx
could	xxxx
transform	xxxx
a	x
mediocre	xxxx
,	,
underperforming	xxxx
team	xxxx
into	xxxx
a	x
dynamic	xxxx
and	xxx
overachieving	xxxx
team	xxxx
.	.
The	Xxx
other	xxxx
Pittsburgh	Xxxxx
superstar	xxxx
,	,
Jaromir	Xxxxx
Jagr	Xxxx
,	,
admires	xxxx
Lemieux	Xxxxx
,	,
who	xxx
might	xxxx
change	xxxx
Jagr	Xxxx
's	'x
recent	xxxx
sulks	xxxx
and	xxx
pouts	xxxx
into	xxxx
shouts	xxxx
of	xx
triumph	xxxx
.	.
At	Xx
the	xxx
very	xxxx
least	xxxx
,	,
Lemieux	Xxxxx
will	xxxx
attract	xxxx
ticket	xxxx
buyers	xxxx
and	xxx
television	xxxx
viewers	xxxx
to	xx
a	x
wintry	xxxx
sport	xxxx
that	xxxx
usually	xxxx
spins	xxxx
its	xxx
wheels	xxxx
along	xxxx
the	xxx
road	xxxx
to	xx
show-business	xxxx
success	xxxx
.	.
So	Xx
what	xxxx
could	xxxx
be	xx
wrong	xxxx
with	xxxx
this	xxxx
picture	xxxx
?	?
Start	Xxxxx
with	xxxx
health	xxxx
.	.
Lemieux	Xxxxx
says	xxxx
his	xxx
back	xxxx
has	xxx
never	xxxx
felt	xxxx
better	xxxx
.	.
One	Xxx
way	xxx
to	xx
change	xxxx
that	xxxx
is	xx
by	xx
playing	xxxx
hockey	xxxx
,	,
which	xxxx
punishes	xxxx
even	xxxx
young	xxxx
,	,
healthy	xxxx
bodies	xxxx
.	.
Can	Xxx
Lemieux	Xxxxx
produce	xxxx
at	xx
a	x
high	xxxx
level	xxxx
at	xx
age	xxx
35	dd
?	?
Perhaps	Xxxxx
,	,
although	xxxx
crackdowns	xxxx
on	xx
obstruction	xxxx
fouls	xxxx
,	,
such	xxxx
as	xx
this	xxxx
season's	xxxx
,	,
tend	xxxx
to	xx
weaken	xxxx
around	xxxx
mid-schedule	xxx
and	xxx
evaporate	xxxx
come	xxxx
playoff	xxxx
time	xxxx
.	.
This	Xxxx
helped	xxxx
persuade	xxxx
Lemieux	Xxxxx
to	xx
retire	xxxx
the	xxx
first	xxxx
time	xxxx
.	.
The	Xxx
third	xxxx
caveat	xxxx
could	xxxx
be	xx
troubles	xxxx
,	,
team	xxxx
-wide	-xxxx
,	,
on	xx
the	xxx
ice	xxx
and	xxx
above	xxxx
it	xx
.	.
Despite	Xxxxx
a	x
shrewd	xxxx
general	xxxx
manager	xxxx
in	xx
Craig	Xxxxx
Patrick	Xxxxx
and	xxx
a	x
loyal	xxxx
fan	xxx
base	xxxx

unsteady	xxxx
since	xxxx
the	xxx
Stanley	Xxxxx
Cup	Xxx
years	xxxx
